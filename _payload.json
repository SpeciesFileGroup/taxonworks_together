Join us for three days of activities centered around building the TaxonWorks community and highlighting what's new, what's changed, and what is on the horizon. We'll share, for example, the release of public pages, more examples for building your taxonomic community, and powerful ways to ask your data questions using Unified Filters). We will learn from those using or experimenting with TaxonWorks in their taxonomic and digitization workflows. As always, we invite new audiences to join us to gather insights for tailoring future directions. Expect lots of opportunities to ask questions, meet others, learn about TaxonWorks, and contribute to the work and conversation. These activities are open events and your feedback and contributions will make a difference. Some activities will be highly guided, some information style, and some unconference style.",{"type":15,"children":90,"toc":98},[91],{"type":92,"tag":93,"props":94,"children":95},"element","p",{},[96],{"type":97,"value":88},"text",{"title":8,"searchDepth":18,"depth":18,"links":99},[],"content:what.md","what.md",{"_path":103,"_dir":8,"_draft":7,"_partial":7,"_locale":8,"_empty":7,"title":104,"description":105,"body":106,"_type":20,"_id":240,"_source":22,"_file":241,"_extension":24},"/how","How","Before the event steps",{"type":15,"children":107,"toc":238},[108,112,227],{"type":92,"tag":93,"props":109,"children":110},{},[111],{"type":97,"value":105},{"type":92,"tag":113,"props":114,"children":115},"ol",{},[116,122,140,156,168,180,194,207,217],{"type":92,"tag":117,"props":118,"children":119},"li",{},[120],{"type":97,"value":121},"Register (see link above) which sends you your Zoom link.",{"type":92,"tag":117,"props":123,"children":124},{},[125,131,133,138],{"type":92,"tag":126,"props":127,"children":128},"strong",{},[129],{"type":97,"value":130},"Get a TaxonWorks account",{"type":97,"value":132}," to discover TaxonWorks now -- it's ",{"type":92,"tag":126,"props":134,"children":135},{},[136],{"type":97,"value":137},"ready-to-use, no software installation needed.",{"type":97,"value":139}," Send email to dlpaul AT illinois DOT edu",{"type":92,"tag":117,"props":141,"children":142},{},[143,145,154],{"type":97,"value":144},"Get a ",{"type":92,"tag":146,"props":147,"children":151},"a",{"href":148,"rel":149},"https://github.com",[150],"nofollow",[152],{"type":97,"value":153},"Github account",{"type":97,"value":155}," (not required, but recommended), an account will help you better participate in many aspects of the community and help you get recognition for the work and expertise you contribute.",{"type":92,"tag":117,"props":157,"children":158},{},[159,161],{"type":97,"value":160},"New to TaxonWorks?
