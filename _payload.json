Join us for three days of activities centered around building the TaxonWorks community and highlighting what's new, what's changed, and what is on the horizon. We'll share, for example, the release of public pages, more examples for building your taxonomic community, and powerful ways to ask your data questions using Unified Filters). We will learn from those using or experimenting with TaxonWorks in their taxonomic and digitization workflows. As always, we invite new audiences to join us to gather insights for tailoring future directions. Expect lots of opportunities to ask questions, meet others, learn about TaxonWorks, and contribute to the work and conversation. These activities are open events and your feedback and contributions will make a difference. Some activities will be highly guided, some information style, and some unconference style.",{"type":15,"children":90,"toc":98},[91],{"type":92,"tag":93,"props":94,"children":95},"element","p",{},[96],{"type":97,"value":88},"text",{"title":8,"searchDepth":18,"depth":18,"links":99},[],"content:what.md","what.md",{"_path":103,"_dir":8,"_draft":7,"_partial":7,"_locale":8,"_empty":7,"title":104,"description":105,"body":106,"_type":20,"_id":196,"_source":22,"_file":197,"_extension":24},"/when","When","Exact Dates TBD - Sept 2023 on Zoom\nSessions daily, free to attend, you'll need to register\nGetting here early?
