Learn from those using TaxonWorks in their taxonomic and digitization workflows. See demos of powerful new ways to query and update data and new interfaces for managing biological associations, i.e. ways to explore and extend digital specimens. See examples of community-building around complex goals of curating data on some of the World's most hyper-diverse taxa. Hear about TaxonWorks' companions, software, people, and data that extend the core functionality and use of the software. For example TaxonPages is a new open-source code base that produces, well, taxon pages, see how its producing well over 100k pages for the Species File Group.
