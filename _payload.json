Recording taxonomic concepts (the particular meaning of a taxonomic name by an author in a publication), and relationships among taxonomic concepts, offers users of species descriptions more refined information than does standard synonymy.  Various software applications have been created to facilitate the management of taxonomic concept data, but none is currently integrated into a comprehensive taxonomic data platform except for TaxonWorks; this capability was added in May 2023 (release 0.33.0). We will demonstrate the process of taxonomic concept mapping, or alignment, in TaxonWorks using preliminary monographic data for the plant genus _Ephedra_.",{"name":28,"title":581},"GeoPick is a new open source online companion tool to the Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman A.D. and Wieczorek J.R.).

Despite this heightened complexity, most geologic collection specimens are stored using a simple specimen model.
