This fits directly into our TW vision and mission to include the community in the building of tools that support taxonomy and offer features and functions as needed by those doing the work. Each new generation of taxonomists is faced with an increasing number of species to define, document and identify. There is also a rapidly increasing number of specimens to examine and identify. Effective tools are essential for researchers to carry out the level of work required to ensure that the world’s biodiversity is understood and conserved. Critically, these need to be readily accessible to students to ensure that they are learning and using the state-of-the-art techniques and tools from the start to the end of their career.
