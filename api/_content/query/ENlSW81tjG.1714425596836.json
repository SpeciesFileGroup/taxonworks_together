With us, you'll have the opportunity to share your insights for how this might work. This fits directly into our TW vision and mission to include the community in the building of tools that support taxonomy and offer features and functions as needed by those doing the work. Each new generation of taxonomists is faced with an increasing number of species to define, document and identify. There is also a rapidly increasing number of specimens to examine and identify. Effective tools are essential for researchers to carry out the level of work required to ensure that the world’s biodiversity is understood and conserved. Critically, these need to be readily accessible to students to ensure that they are learning and using the state-of-the-art techniques and tools from the start of their career. This session will discuss the role of TaxonWorks in education programmes and how we can provide access and training to new generations of taxonomy students."},{"start":"15:30","speakers":["Open Conversation"],"title":"Our collective geospatial future","description":"An open conversation on geospatial topics (technical and social) that intersect with our workbenches.
