Before the event steps

1. Register (see link above) which sends you your Zoom link.
2. **Get a TaxonWorks account** to discover TaxonWorks now -- it's **ready-to-use, no software installation needed.** Send email to dlpaul AT illinois DOT edu
3. Get a [Github account](https://github.com) (not required, but recommended), an account will help you better participate in many aspects of the community and help you get recognition for the work and expertise you contribute.
4. New to TaxonWorks? Learn about TaxonWorks features and functions via the [TaxonWorks YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNr7QYwvVFcRfQAcMEAhLw)
5. [Post ideas, requests, questions](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_together_2023/issues) for our event sessions
6. If you are software developer and you want to hack TaxonWorks itself, please start reading [install_taxonworks](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/install_taxonworks/blob/master/development/README.md). You Don't Need To Install TW locally to use it. (See number 2 above).
7. Got data in TaxonWorks already? Looking to experiment to see what your TaxonPages will look like? Try installing this software "locally" (on your computer) to find out. (You will need to install Node on your machine, and git, there’s a link in the above instructions). You can also “see” other sites, if their API is open, look here: https://sandcastle.taxonworks.org/api/v1.
8. **3 Minutes 1 Slide**: If you would like to present your insights or ideas on a given topic about TaxonWorks, let us know! We'll work it in or add to our post-TaxonWorks Together events. Send email to dlpaul AT illinois DOT edu
