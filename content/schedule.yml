What is proving to be key (or still challenging) in getting folks to adopt new processes / standards-of-practice? What tools, products, and resources do you envision we need going forward? What should we do next?  When we're caught up with nomenclature, or hit a specific milestone, what steps will catalyze future growth for our communities?'
