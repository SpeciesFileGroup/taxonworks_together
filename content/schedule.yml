            title: 'Using TaxonWorks to document and align taxonomic concepts in Ephedra. Co-authored with Stefanie Ickert-Bond. Recording taxonomic concepts (the particular meaning of a taxonomic name by an author in a publication), and relationships among taxonomic concepts, offers users of species descriptions more refined information than does standard synonymy.  Various software applications have been created to facilitate the management of taxonomic concept data, but none is currently integrated into a comprehensive taxonomic data platform except for TaxonWorks; this capability was added in May 2023 (release 0.33.0). We will demonstrate the process of taxonomic concept mapping, or alignment, in TaxonWorks using preliminary monographic data for the plant genus Ephedra.'

            title: 'Using ChatGPT with Confidence for Biodiversity-Related Information Tasks. Abstract: Emerging AI services like ChatGPT can provide us with information on nearly any topic, but sometimes make mistakes. This sporadic unreliability limits the usability of AI in scientific workflows. We propose a method for gauging confidence in AI outputs. In an experiment using ChatGPT to predict species occurrences, we show that a desired reliability can be reached by only trusting high-confidence predictions.'
          - name: Tommy McElrath
            title: 'How quickly can new accessions generate citations of a collection? Abstract: How can you make sure that the impact of your collection or your specimens are actually measured? New digital infrastructure has made it so that hypothetically, anyone can collect, digitize, and upload a digital specimen to an aggregator for that specimen to be used to answer many different scientific questions. In this talk, I will examine what tools make this possible, but also where this process breaks down, and in doing so, examine what specimens are currently making the most "impact" at the INHS Insect Collection. (Regretfully, Tommy had to back out. We'll ask him to do this talk soon from our next TaxonWorks event).'
