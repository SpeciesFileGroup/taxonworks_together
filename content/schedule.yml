Recording taxonomic concepts (the particular meaning of a taxonomic name by an author in a publication), and relationships among taxonomic concepts, offers users of species descriptions more refined information than does standard synonymy.  Various software applications have been created to facilitate the management of taxonomic concept data, but none is currently integrated into a comprehensive taxonomic data platform except for TaxonWorks; this capability was added in May 2023 (release 0.33.0). We will demonstrate the process of taxonomic concept mapping, or alignment, in TaxonWorks using preliminary monographic data for the plant genus Ephedra.'

            title: 'How quickly can new accessions generate citations of a collection? Abstract: How can you make sure that the impact of your collection or your specimens are actually measured? New digital infrastructure has made it so that hypothetically, anyone can collect, digitize, and upload a digital specimen to an aggregator for that specimen to be used to answer many different scientific questions. In this talk, I will examine what tools make this possible, but also where this process breaks down, and in doing so, examine what specimens are currently making the most "impact" at the INHS Insect Collection.'
