Our 5th TaxonWorks Together, *21-23 May 2024*. Join us for 3 days of activities centered around building the collective [TaxonWorks](http://taxonworks.org) community within the broader context of biodiversity informatics around the world, highlighting what's new, changed, and on the horizon. Activities range from highly guided, to un-conference style, with informational (demos, new features, participant presentations) and conversational (e.g. round-table, Q & A) opportunities mixed throughout.  As always, we invite new audiences to join us to gather insights for tailoring future directions, our topics will range from those involving TaxonWorks directly (how can we improve) to grand-challenges facing or collective communities (e.g. data quality, semantics and standards, sustaining communities, agency).

_Expect lots of opportunities to ask questions, meet others, and to contribute the conversation, your feedback and contributions will make a difference._
